!This is a program to calculate sum and poroduct

program sum_product
    I=24 !Fortran take I,J,K,L,M,N as Integer by default
    J=3
    K=7
    LS = I+J+K !L means integer as like above
    LP=I*J*k !we assign sum of I,J,K in LS and product of I,J,K in LP
    PRINT*,"THSE SUM AND PRODUCT OF",I,J,K ,"",LS,LP ! use PRINT*, to print
end program
